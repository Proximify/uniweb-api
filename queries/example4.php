/**
 * In this example we add new items into a CV section. In particular, we chose a
 * section that includes two kinds of special fields: bilingual fields and section fields.
 * This two types of fields are special because their values are arrays that must have
 * a particular structure. The bilingual are straight forward. They must have an 'english'
 * and a 'french' property (although it is valid to omit a language if there is no value
 * for it).
 * The fields that are of type 'section' represent subsections of the section to where
 * the field belongs. The value of a section field must be an array of items.
 *
 * In addition, the example below show that the API request can be give as a JSON string
 * or as a regular PHP array. Depending the context one method can be more convenient
 * that the other. Here the first request is defined as a JSON string and the other
 * ones as PHP arrays.
